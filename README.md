emacs-travis.mk
===============

Install Emacs and its tooling on Travis CI.

`emacs-travis.mk` is a small Makefile which provides targets to install Emacs
stable and emacs-snapshot, Texinfo and Cask on the Docker-based infrastructure
of Travis CI.  It compiles a minimal Emacs and Texinfo from source and installs
them into `$HOME/bin`.

Usage
=====

Add the following to your `.travis.yml`:

``` yaml
language: emacs-lisp
sudo: false
cache:
  - directories:
      # Cache stable Emacs binaries (saves 1min per job)
      - "$HOME/emacs/"
# Allow Emacs snapshot builds to fail and don’t wait for these as they can take
# a looooong time
matrix:
  fast_finish: true
  allow_failures:
    - env: EMACS_VERSION=snapshot
env:
  - EMACS_VERSION=24.3
  - EMACS_VERSION=24.5
  - EMACS_VERSION=25.1
  - EMACS_VERSION=25.2
  - EMACS_VERSION=snapshot
before_install:
  # Configure $PATH: Executables are installed to $HOME/bin
  - export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"
  # Download the makefile to emacs-travis.mk
  - wget 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flycheck/emacs-travis/master/emacs-travis.mk'
  # Install Emacs (according to $EMACS_VERSION) and Cask
  - make -f emacs-travis.mk install_emacs
  - make -f emacs-travis.mk install_cask
  # Install Texinfo, if you need to build info manuals for your project
  - make -f emacs-travis.mk install_texinfo
install:
  # Install your dependencies
  - cask install
script:
  # Run your tests
  - cask exec ert-runner
```

This setup builds and tests your Emacs Lisp project on Emacs 24.3, 24.5, 25.1,
25.2 and the current Emacs snapshot from Git.

Note: To use Texinfo you'll need `libperl.so`. For example in Ubuntu you can
install it by using command as follows:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libperl-dev
```

Reference
---------

To install, download the `emacs-travis.mk` script in your `.travis.yml`, and run
it with `make -f` as in the example above.

Environment variables (set these in the `env:` section of your `.travis.yml`):

- `$EMACS_VERSION`: The Emacs version to install.  Supports any released version
  of GNU Emacs (tested with 24.1 and upwards), release candidates
  (e.g. `25.1-rc2`) or the special value `snapshot` to clone the latest `master`
  from Emacs’ Git.  Defaults to the latest stable release of GNU Emacs.
- `$TEXINFO_VERSION`: The Texinfo version to install.  Supports any released
  version of GNU Texinfo (tested with 5.2 and upwards).  Defaults to the latest
  stable release of GNU Texinfo.

Additional environment variables (for special purposes):

- `$EMACSCONFFLAGS`: Flags for `./configure` when building Emacs.  Defaults to
  building a minimal Emacs, without almost all features

Targets (for use in `before_install`):

- `install_cask`: Install Cask
- `install_emacs`: Install GNU Emacs, as per `$EMACS_VERSION`
- `install_texinfo`: Install GNU Texinfo, as per `$TEXINFO_VERSION`
